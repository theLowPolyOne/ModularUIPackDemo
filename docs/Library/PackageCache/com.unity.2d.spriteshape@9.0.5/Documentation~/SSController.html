<h1 id="sprite-shape-controller">Sprite Shape Controller</h1>

<p>The <strong>Sprite Shape Controller</strong> component is automatically attached to the GameObject created when a <a href="SSProfile.html">Sprite Shape Profile</a> is dragged into the Scene. You edit the shape of the Sprite Shape's outline through the Controller's settings. The Controller displays different settings depending on different conditions.</p>
<h2 id="property-settings---default">Property Settings - Default</h2>
<p>The default component settings below are displayed when Edit Spline is not enabled.</p>

<h3 id="stretched-corners">Stretched Corners</h3>
<p>This feature allows the Sprite Shape to form corners with stretched Sprites between adjacent edges between the corner point and its neighbors. Select the Stretched option from the <strong>Corner</strong> dropdown menu, and ensure the following criteria are met:</p>
<ol>
<li>Both the selected and adjacent points have the same <strong>Height</strong>.</li>
<li>Sprites rendered at the Corner point and its neighboring points must have the same Sprite pivot position.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="additional-collider-settings">Additional Collider settings</h3>
<p>Add either the <strong>Polygon Collider 2D</strong> or <strong>Edge Collider 2D</strong> component to the <strong>Sprite Shape</strong> to enable additional <strong>Collider</strong> settings in the <strong>Sprite Shape Controller</strong>. Refer to <a href="SSCollision.html">Enabling Collision</a> for more details about enabling Colliders with Sprite Shapes. Colliders are always optimized by cleaning up extra control points that are colinear.</p>

<h2 id="editing-the-spline">Editing the Spline</h2>
<p>To edit the mesh outline of the <strong>Sprite Shape</strong>, click the <strong>Edit Spline</strong> button to make the Shape's spline and its <strong>Control Points</strong> become visible and editable.</p>
<p><img src="images/UpdatedEditSpline_2019-3.png" alt="Edit Spline enabled"></p>
<p>When <strong>Edit Spline</strong> is enabled, move the Control Points of the Sprite Shape to adjust its overall shape and size. Add additional Control Points by clicking on the spline in between Control Points. Press the <strong>Del/Delete</strong> key to remove the currently selected Control Point.</p>
<p><img src="images/2D_SpriteShape_032.png" alt="Control Point added to spline"></p>
<p>With a Control Point selected, cycle through the __Point Modes __by pressing the <strong>M</strong> key. To change the <strong>Mode</strong> of multiple Control Points at once, ensure that all selected Control Points are the same <strong>Mode</strong> first before cycling or selecting another <strong>Mode</strong>.</p>
<p>To change the Sprite Variant currently displayed at a selected Control Point, press the <strong>N</strong> key to cycle through all available Variants.</p>
<p>All shortcut keys can be rebound under the Shortcut menu (menu: <strong>Edit &gt; Shortcuts... &gt; SpriteShape Editing</strong>).</p>
<h2 id="point-modes">Point Modes</h2>
<p>When a Control Point is selected, its <strong>Point Mode</strong> can be one of three modes- <strong>Linear</strong>, <strong>Mirrored</strong>, and <strong>Non-Mirrored</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Point Mode</strong> determines the behavior of the tangents that are used to adjust the spline between Control Points. Each Control Point can be set to a specific Point Mode and contain its own settings.</p>
<h3 id="linear-point-mode">Linear Point Mode</h3>
<p>In <strong>Linear Point Mode</strong>, there are no tangents to control the curve between the Control Point and its neighbors, curves are not formed between Control Points and Sprites may overlap if they intersect.</p>
<p>Adjust which Sprite is displayed when two or more intersect by adjusting their <strong>Order</strong> value in the <a href="SSProfile.html">Sprite Shape Profile's</a> <strong>Angle Range</strong> settings.</p>
<p><img src="images/2D_SpriteShape_034.png" alt="Linear Point Mode"></p>
<h3 id="continuous-mirrored-point-mode">Continuous Mirrored Point Mode</h3>
<p>In <strong>Continuous Mirrored Point Mode</strong>, tangents appear on both sides of the selected Control Point to create a curve between the Control Point and its neighbors. Adjust the shape of the curve with the tangents. In this mode, the angle between the tangents is always maintained at 180 degrees although their lengths from the can vary.</p>
<p>Press <strong>B</strong> to mirror the length of the last edited tangent onto the opposite tangent.</p>
<p><img src="images/2D_SpriteShape_033.png" alt="Mirrored Point Mode"></p>
<h3 id="broken-mirrored-point-mode">Broken Mirrored Point Mode</h3>
<p>In <strong>Broken Mirrored Point Mode</strong>,  tangents appear on both sides of the selected Control Point to create a curve between the Control Point and its neighbors. Adjust the shape of the curve with the tangents. In this mode, the length and angle of each tangent can be adjusted independently.</p>
<p>Press <strong>B</strong> to mirror the length of the last edited tangent onto the opposite tangent. In this mode, pressing <strong>B</strong> also causes the angle of the opposite tangent to become exactly 180 degrees from the last edited tangent.</p>
