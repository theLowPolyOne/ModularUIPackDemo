<p>All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.</p>
<p>The format is based on <a href="http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/">Keep a Changelog</a>
and this project adheres to <a href="http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html">Semantic Versioning</a>.</p>
<h2 id="115---2025-02-14">[1.1.5] - 2025-02-14</h2>
<h3 id="added">Added</h3>
<ul>
<li>Managed fields referencing native allocations are now parsed as references. References show up in the References To tab for the managed objects holding the references, as well as in the Referenced By tab for native allocations under <code>Native &gt; Unity Subsystems &gt; UnsafeUtility</code> in the All Of Memory table. Note that this is not an exhaustive list of all references to these allocations, as stack variables could reference them as well but are not part of the snapshot. Thus, a native allocation without references is not necessarily leaked.</li>
<li>Native Allocations (e.g. those listed in <code>Native &gt; Unity Subsystems &gt; UnsafeUtility</code> in the All Of Memory table) are now named based on the field and object information of the first managed reference to them, making them easier to parse than address values and stand out from the list as having reference information.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fixed">Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Boehm GC treats any pointer sized field as potential managed pointer. So far the Memory Profiler only examined reference fields to find referenced objects (outside of those directly held by static fields or GCHandles). The Memory Profiler does not yet follow this logic as it would end up finding invalid Managed objects, but it now finds references from unsafe pointer fields to Managed Objects that are also held by a GC Handle.</li>
<li>The Managed Fields table now shows any pointer sized fields that might be holding managed objects as referencing these managed objects (Note: if they are not referenced otherwise, they won't sho up in the other tables).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="changed">Changed</h3>
<ul>
<li>The References To table now shows field information for references held by managed fields</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="114---2025-02-07">[1.1.4] - 2025-02-07</h2>
<h3 id="added-1">Added</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added memory amount taken up by static field data to Virtual Machine Memory description when selecting it. It usually is a very small portion of the VM but it is one that all snapshots already have data for.</li>
<li>Added snapshot meta data description (reported via an implementation of <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.memoryprofiler@1.1/api/Unity.MemoryProfiler.MetadataCollect.html"><code>Unity.MemoryProfiler.MetadataCollect</code></a> or <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.1/Documentation/ScriptReference/Unity.Profiling.Memory.MemoryProfiler.CreatingMetadata.html"><code>Unity.Profiling.Memory.MemoryProfiler.CreatingMetadata</code></a>) to the tooltips of the snapshot screenshot images.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fixed-1">Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed native sizes getting trimmed down for Native Objects captured in snapshots from Unity versions before 2022.2, when their Native Allocations did not fall within reported memory regions. This trimming falsely assumed proper memory region reporting.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="changed-1">Changed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved object size information in selection details view; now lists Graphics memory.</li>
<li>Showing Graphics sizes in All Of Memory table for snapshots of Unity versions prior to 2022.2 and adjusting native sizes to rely on Profiler.GetRuntimeMemorySizeLong data for these captures.</li>
<li>Switched Unity Objects table and summary to use the explicitly reported graphics sizes for all snapshots taken from 2022.2 or newer, instead of 2023.1 or newer. 2022.2 and 2022.3 had this data but was displaying graphics sizes based on calculations using Profiler.GetRuntimeMemorySizeLong data. Earlier 2022.2 and 2022.3 versions had different bugs in the reported values for the explicitly reported graphics sizes so snapshots taken between version 2022.2.0a8 and 2022.3.7f1 might have shown different graphics and native sizes on the Unity Objects table vs what the All Of Memory table was showing for them. Small discrepancies in native memory reporting, that also might have had an influence on the graphics and native sizes shown in the two tables have been fixed in 2022.3.43f1 so for the most reliable data, use that or a newer version for profiling.</li>
<li>Grouping all <code>Graphics &gt; &lt;No Name&gt;</code> entries into one. If you have these, please update to at least Unity patch version: 2022.3.44f1 or 6000.0.0b16</li>
<li>Improved the documentation for <code>MetadataCollect</code> API.</li>
<li>Opening the Memory Profiler window no longer starts indexing the <code>assets</code> search provider by default, leading to potential crashes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="113---2024-10-31">[1.1.3] - 2024-10-31</h2>
<h3 id="fixed-2">Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Static field references were only listed in the References view if they directly referenced the selected item, i.e. a static field referencing an object B that referenced the selected object A would only show object B, but not the static reference to B (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/PROFB-173">PROFB-173</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed an ArgumentOutOfRangeException when opening the Unity Objects page in compare mode with 2 snapshots that were captured without capturing Native Objects.</li>
<li>Fixed a NullReferenceException when opening the All of Memory page in compare mode with 2 snapshots that were captured without capturing Native Objects but with Native Allocations, both from the same session.</li>
<li>Fixed the ID numbers for Graphics objects on the All of Memory page in compare mode with 2 snapshots that where both captured from the same session to be their Native Object's instance ID.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="changed-2">Changed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted package dependency on Unity.Collections down to 1.2 to retain compatibility to 2022.3 without forcing to update Unity.Collections to 2.1 or newer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="112---2024-10-24">[1.1.2] - 2024-10-24</h2>
<h3 id="fixed-3">Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Memory Profiler UI freezing on selecting Unity Objects when the search index hasn't been built yet.</li>
<li>Reattributed Nintendo Switch's reserved GPU memory from Native to Graphics in the Summary view and All Of Memory table.</li>
<li>Improved the performance of the Managed Data Crawler by using the Job System when parsing managed array data with potential references to managed objects. In some worst case scenarios this brings the opening times down from several hours to &lt;5min, thereby fixing <a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/PROFB-191">PROFB-191</a>.</li>
<li>Fixed misalignment of managed object sizes shown in the All Of Memory table vs. what is shown in the selected item details where that was caused by faulty readings of the managed heap data in the package (reading something as a potential reference to effectively random memory that looks close enough to a valid object, but not quiet), or faulty data reported by the capture backend (caused by e.g. the capture process allowing the creation of new Unity Objects between capturing the managed heap data and reporting all GC Handles held by currently alive Unity Objects(UUM-77449, fixed in 6000.0.16f1, 2022.3.43f1 2021.3.44f1) and/or an incomplete reporting of reserved but unused heap bytes (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/UUM-53413">UUM-53413</a>)) leading to the package &quot;discovering&quot; managed objects that can't reasonably exist as live objects because their size exceeds the reported heap bytes. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/PROFB-118">PROFB-118</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed inclusion of allocated GPU memory on the Nintendo Switch on the All Of Memory table under <code>Native &gt; Unity Subsystem &gt; Unknown</code>. Instead, it is now shown under <code>Graphics (Estimated)</code> and/or <code>Untracked &gt; Graphics</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="changed-3">Changed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved accuracy of the search for Assets and Scene Objects within the open project which is used for the &quot;Select in Editor&quot; button, Open in Search and Preview Image by constraining it to exact names.</li>
<li>Improved responsiveness of table item selection of Unity Objects (in any table) by switching the Assets and Scene Object search triggered by that selection to run async instead of synchronous.</li>
<li>The All Of Memory table now lists all individual allocation under Native &gt; Unity Subsystem &gt; UnsafeUtility to allow for checking the count and size of different allocations made via UnsafeUtility.</li>
<li>Selecting items in the Graphics category of the All Of Memory table, when they represent the GPU side of a Unity Object, now shows the details for that Unity Object.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="111---2024-09-10">[1.1.1] - 2024-09-10</h2>
<h3 id="added-2">Added</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added the name of the assembly to the Type details when selecting a Managed Type group.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fixed-4">Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed navigating with arrow keys not updating reference list in All of Memory view (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/PROFB-153">PROFB-153</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed retention of Snapshot list expansion and scroll state so that it does not expand all items unexpectedly but remembers which sessions were collapsed and which extended (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/PROFB-196">PROFB-196</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed dropdown text being clipped when &quot;Allocated and Resident Memory on Device&quot; was selected.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue whereby graphics allocations not associated with a native object would display under a &quot;No Name&quot; category in the All of Memory table.</li>
<li>Fixed issues with selecting array objects, or objects that had managed fields with arrays, when the arrays where multidimensional with one or more dimensions of size 0.</li>
<li>Fixed exception when opening the Unity Objects table in Comparison mode when there are multiple MonoBehaviour or ScriptableObject types with the same name but from different assemblies.</li>
<li>Fixed exception when opening the All Of Memory table in Comparison mode when either of the snapshots is from a pre 2022.2 runtime and the untracked amount is negative.</li>
<li>Fixed an ArgumentOutOfRangeException when inspecting some Managed Objects (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/PROFB-223">PROFB-223</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed longer string values not being displayed in the Managed Fields Inspector.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused IL2CPP VM memory to not be calculated correctly in the Summary and All Of Memory table.</li>
<li>Remove deprecated UxmlFactory/UxmlTraits API usage on Unity 6.</li>
<li>Add divider on &quot;Capture&quot; toolbar button dropdown.</li>
<li>Reattributed IL2CPP VM memory from Native to Managed in the All Of Memory table.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="changed-4">Changed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Allowed Snapshots to reside in Subfolders within the configured memory snapshot path.</li>
<li>Improved Snapshots folder monitoring: Changes to the folder are now reflected in the Editor without it requiring to acquire focus first.</li>
<li>Improved display of managed arrays in the Selected Item Details and Managed Fields.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="110---2023-10-16">[1.1.0] - 2023-10-16</h2>
<h3 id="changed-5">Changed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bump version to 1.1.0 from 1.1.0-pre.3.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="110-pre3---2023-09-27">[1.1.0-pre.3] - 2023-09-27</h2>
<h3 id="fixed-5">Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an exception on capturing when the default snapshot storage path was used (./MemoryCaptures) but did not exist. It now gets created if it is missing. Custom set storage paths will still not be created as issues with these need user input to get resolved properly.</li>
<li>Fixed an ArgumentOutOfRangeException in ManagedObjectInspector on selecting some object entries in the All of Memory and Unity Objects table. The field inspector UI was trying to display the managed field values of static fields that hadn't been initialized.</li>
<li>Fixed Snapshot opening triggering a synchronous search via SearchService to initialize it for the Select, Find and Asset Preview functionality. As that could trigger SearchService to start indexing, this might have lead to longer stalls on opening snapshots.</li>
<li>Fixed string rendering when strings included the ´\r´ character (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/PROFB-113">PROFB-113</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed a crash on opening snapshots with very large managed memory usage (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/PROFB-156">PROFB-156</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed messaging for resident memory breakdown data availability. Detailed resident memory breakdown data is available for snapshots taken from Unity versions 2023.1 or newer.</li>
<li>Fixed the Unity Object and All Of Memory table UI so that the table mode dropdown does not disappear in a narrow window size. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/PROFB-110">PROFB-110</a>)</li>
<li>Disabled resident memory visualization in &quot;Unity Objects&quot; and &quot;All of Memory&quot; tables for WebGL platform. WebGL doesn't provide residency status.</li>
<li>Fixed bug that detailed information isn't showed for graphics resources.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug when you can't switch snapshot if snapshot was previously open in compare mode.</li>
<li>Fixed a managed memory leak in the Memory Profiler Module UI that the package inserts into the Profiler Window (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/PROFB-160">PROFB-160</a>). Also reduced the impact of a Mesh memory leak caused by UI TK (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/UUM-46520">UUM-46520</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed the display of the memory usage bar diagrams in the Memory Profiler Module UI that the package inserts into the Profiler Window (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/PROFB-165">PRFOB-165</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed issue with Unity Objects view that caused some managed objects not to group and shown as separate items.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="changed-6">Changed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Documentation updated.</li>
<li>The &quot;Search In Project&quot; button now searches in the Assets folder <em>and</em> in Packages (related to (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/PROFB-54">PROFB-54</a>)).</li>
<li>Improved the performance of selecting items in the All Of Memory and Unity Objects tables for objects with managed memory. This affected in particular objects which have a lot of entries (their own or nested fields) displayed in their Managed Fields in the Selection Details panel. Beyond improving the performance in general, 'Continue...' entries, which can be clicked to get further entries added to the view, now not only appear in fields 4 layers down and for big arrays, but also after a total of 1000 field entries have been added to the view.</li>
</ul>

<li>Fixed Selection Details foldouts so that they retain their expansion status for the duration of an Editor session and not change on every selection change.</li>
<li>Fixed screenshots remaining after deleting snapshots.</li>
<li>Fixed situations where the highlighted element in tables did not reflect the displayed selection but could not be clicked to show its details in the selection, particularly when the selected row item would change due to search filtering the table, switching back to a previously visited view.</li>
<li>Fixed leaks of native UnsafeUtility.Malloc(Persistent) allocations that occurred when the Editor recompiled code while a snapshot was open.</li>
<li>Fixed leaks of Persistent NativeArray allocations via the Snapshot FileReader occurring with every (attempted) opening of a snapshot.</li>

<li>Changed the naming of managed object entries in tables when they are not connected to a native Unity Object from &quot;No Name&quot; to their address. Strings and char arrays additionally show their first characters after their address value. Entries for Unity Objects that had their native object destroyed further get the postfix &quot;(Leaked Shell)&quot; after their address.</li>
<li>Changed Unity Object comparison for same session comparisons to further distinguish Unity Objects by their Instance IDs, unless the table is flattened.</li>
<li>Improved Preview, Search and Select In Editor functionality, especially for Scene Objects.</li>

<li>Fixed IndexOutOfBoundsException when selecting Managed Type groups in the All Of Memory table if all instances are Leaked Shell objects.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the Select In Editor button was available, even though the selected object did not clearly refer to one particular item. Clicking the button could therefore select the wrong item. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/PROFB-54">PROFB-54</a>)</li>

<h3 id="added-9">Added</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added the 'Unity Objects' view to show a breakdown of memory contributing to all Unity Objects. This enables you to more easily understand the total memory impact of the assets and objects in your project by showing you their total, native, and managed sizes in one place. Unity Objects are grouped by their types, such as Texture2D, Material, and Mesh. Use the 'Search By Name' functionality to filter the view to specific objects. Use the 'Flatten Hierarchy' functionality to remove the Type groupings.</li>
<li>Added the 'Potential Duplicates' view to show a breakdown of all potential duplicate Unity Objects. Potential duplicates, which are Unity Objects of the same type, name, and size, might represent the same asset loaded multiple times in memory.</li>
<li>Added the 'All Tracked Memory' view to show a breakdown of all tracked memory that Unity knows about.</li>

<h2 id="050-preview1---2022-02-02">[0.5.0-preview.1] - 2022-02-02</h2>
<h3 id="added-11">Added</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added selection events to the view history.</li>
<li>Added details panel. This is context aware and will show extra information about whatever the current selection is.
<ul>
<li>Referenced By (Raw) section: This section of the details panel shows the connections to the current selection, where applicable. This can be used to determine the paths to objects that are holding objects in memory and is currently designed as a 1:1 match to the references column click through from the object tables.</li>
<li>Selection Details section: This section of the details panel displays, where possible, additional information about the currently selected item e.g. the fields on a managed object or the description of the currently selected memory usage overview category.
<ul>
<li>Showing these details is currently only implemented for Managed or Native Objects, Managed or Native Types and the breakdown categories in the Memory Usage Overview.</li>
<li>If an Object is selected that inherits from UnityEngine.Object (a &quot;Unity Object&quot;) that has a Managed Shell to its Native Object, the Selection Details treat it as one object, giving you all the info for both of them and list out details separately as well were useful.</li>
<li>Where applicable, the selected item is searched for in the editor. If there is exactly one item found in the editor which match the search criteria, which is either the Instance ID (if the capture is from the current Editor Session) or its Name and Type, two things become available
<ul>
<li>The &quot;Select in Editor&quot; button to ping the object in the Scene Hierarchy or Project Browser and to select the object so it's details are shown in any open Inspector view.</li>
<li>If applicable, a preview is loaded from the object in the Editor. (NOTE: This is NOT how the object necessarily looked in the build. The search logic may have found a different object or it may have been changed since the build was made. This is just to potentially help in identifying the Object in the capture faster.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Regardless of the results of the search for a specific object, the new &quot;Search in Scene/Project&quot; button can always help in finding Assets or Scene Objects quickly.</li>
<li>In Unity 2021.1 and newer, an additional button will open Quick Search.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added the ability to hide table columns and reduced the set of columns shown by default down to the most commonly useful ones. The reasoning for hiding these is:
<ul>
<li>With the managed fields moved to the Selection Details section, the &quot;Static&quot; and &quot;Field Target Size&quot; columns have become redundant, and so has the ability to expand Managed Objects to see their fields, and the &quot;Address&quot; column to see the field layout clearer.</li>
<li>With the Selection Details section showing a Unity Object's managed and Native info as one, the Managed Objects no longer show their Native Object's size and instead of splitting their size into a Managed Size and a Native Size column, the tables now only show one Size column and one Name Column by default.</li>
<li>The Native Instance ID is also shown in the Selection Details under the Advanced tab. The most important info from it is considered for the &quot;Status&quot; displayed in the &quot;Basic&quot; info section (i.e. negative = Runtime Created, Positive = Loaded from file).</li>
<li>If you took a snapshot of the current editor session, the Instance ID is used by the &quot;Select in Editor&quot; button in the Selection Details section to select the instance. It therefore no longer needs to be displayed as a link in the table.</li>
<li>All other links in the tables have also been disabled, as they would only help see further details for an object, that now live in the Selection Details section</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added a &quot;Count&quot; and a &quot;Total Size&quot; label above each table that dynamically adjusts as you filter the table.</li>
<li>The Managed Fields inspector in the Selection Details section has some additions over what was previously shown in the tables:
<ul>
<li>It links up NativeArray fields that point to native Allocations with these allocations for easier analysis of DOTS memory usage.</li>
<li>For IntPtr fields, it tries to find the Object, Allocation or Region that the IntPtr points at, and shows the information it finds.</li>
<li>For UnityEngine.Object.m_CachedPointer it shows the Native Object that the Managed Shell Object points to.</li>
<li>Recursive reference chains are caught and truncated so that it is safe to use Alt/Option + LMB click to expand the tree all the way. Though right now, to keep processing times low, it only searches 3 levels deep at a time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added toggle to truncate type names in the details panel. It can be accessed through the kebab menu icon and the context menu of both the managed object inspector and referenced by tree views.</li>
</ul>

<li>The Name column in the tables now shows managed string content in quotes.</li>

<li>Fixed an IndexOutOfBoundsException when sorting size tables in the Memory Map's Object list and switching to the Region or Allocations lists.</li>
<li>Fixed the row size option in the Fragmentation view not being properly stored across sessions for Fragmentation analysis of snapshots in comparison mode.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the crawler would find impossibly big string objects, inflating Managed Object Memory and causing exceptions when these were to be drawn in a table <a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/1393878/">(Case 1393878)</a>.</li>

or any newer version of Unity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="added-15">Added</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added a collapsible &quot;Memory Usage Overview&quot; section containing a high level breakdown of the Memory usage.
<ul>
<li>It shows the same breakdowns as the Profiler Window's simple Memory Profiler panel, adding two more categories which are untracked in the Profiler Window: Virtual Machine and Executable and DLLs</li>
<li>It additionally shows a breakdown of Managed Memory usage into Virtual Machine (currently only available when using the Mono scripting backend), Objects and the two kinds of free reserved space, either in the Active Heap section, or as Fragmented Heap in older sections.
Note that Fragmented Heap Space can be reused for Managed Object memory, if new objects fit into contiguous free space in it. You can use the Fragmentation page to analyze your memory usage if you seem to have a lot of fragmented memory.
This breakdown should help you determine if it might be worth to dig deeper into Fragmentation or your Managed Object usage, or if there are other areas to focus on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added a collapsible &quot;Top Issues&quot; section containing some identified issues with the opened snapshot. On opening a snapshot, checks will be run and entries added to the list.
Note: There are a lot of memory usage scenarios that might be problematic but are not clear cut enough for an algorithm without any context of the project to make any determination on.
This list can therefore not be exhaustive but aims to offer a helpful start into memory investigations.
More checks will be added going forward. The current set of checks will add:
<ul>
<li>A warning if the snapshot was taken from a Unity Editor, as memory usage in the Editor might be misleading compared to memory usage in a build.</li>
<li>A warning if the System Allocator is used.</li>
<li>An info entry if the snapshot was taken with some options for capturing disabled.</li>
<li>A warning when comparing snapshots that were taken with different capturing options being enabled.</li>
<li>An info entry when comparing snapshots taken from different sessions or an unknown session, as this will affect the detail level at which differences can be checked.</li>
<li>An info entry when comparing snapshots taken from different Unity versions, as observed changes in memory could be due to the version change instead of a change in the project. The version numbers are shown if they are known.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added a view selection Ribbon
<ul>
<li>Renamed the Memory Map view to Fragmentation page.</li>
<li>Moved all Table views into the new Objects and Allocations page.</li>
<li>Renamed the Tree Map view to Summary page.
<ul>
<li>This is an intermediate step in a larger UI refactor. In a next step, the Summary page will get new top level summary sections and the Tree Map view will be moved to the Objects and Allocations page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added an option to the drop-down of the Capture button to not take a screenshot on capture.</li>
<li>Added Virtual Machine memory as a category to Memory Map. This relies on changes made to the snapshot data and only works for any snapshots taken from Unity versions 2021.2.0a12, 2021.1.9, 2020.3.12f1, 2019.4.29f1 or newer. Only builds made against the Mono Scripting Back-end report Virtual Machine memory usage. IL2CPP does, as of yet, not report any of its Virtual Machine memory usage. This also addresses <a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/987987/">(Case 987987)</a></li>
<li>Added a Button to open the package's documentation to the top right corner.</li>
<li>Added a Menu button to the top right corner, containing an option to show the Memory Profiler's Preferences window.</li>
<li>Added a &quot;Snapshot Window&quot; Button to the top left corner to toggle the visibility of the open snapshots pane and the snapshots list.</li>
<li>Added the ability to set match row filtering for string based rows to check for exact (case-insensitive) matches additionally to the existing option to filter if it contains the searched string.</li>
<li>Added a replacement for the details view of the <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ProfilerWindow.html">Profiler Window</a>'s <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ProfilerMemory.html">Memory Profiler module</a>. If the Package is installed, it will provide the UI for the Memory Profiler module for Unity versions of 2021.2 or newer.</li>
<li>Added a setting to <code>Preferences / Analysis / Memory Profiler / Replace Memory UI in Profiler Window</code> to toggle the Memory Profiler Module replacement on or off.</li>
<li>Added &quot;All Native Allocations&quot; table which lists the Memory Region, Area and Root Object names for each Allocation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="changed-19">Changed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Changed the snapshot list UI by:
<ul>
<li>Moving the open snapshots section to the top</li>
<li>Adding a bar to break-down the total allocated memory vs. the systems maximally available memory to each snapshot (only works for snapshots taken form 2021.2.0a12, 2021.1.9, 2020.3.12f1, 2019.4.29f1 or newer)</li>
<li>Grouping snapshots taken from the same session together and listing the project name along side them (only works for snapshots taken form 2021.2.0a12, 2021.1.9, 2020.3.12f1, 2019.4.29f1 or newer, older snapshots are grouped into the &quot;Unknown Session&quot;)</li>
<li>Moved snapshots options (Rename, Delete, Open Folder) into right-click context menu.</li>
<li>Snapshots are now refereed to as &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; when comparing them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed table UI so that it no longer starts glitching when looking at tables of over 60000 rows.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Memory Map would draw Native Objects over other Native Objects and over the end of their Native Region. The UI falsely assumed that an Object's memory is contiguous, starting from the address to the Object's header. In reality it may consist of several buffers and other allocations distributed across different memory regions. Right now, the memory reporting of Native UnityEngine.Objects is not detailed enough (broken down to each allocation) to clarify just where all of an Object's memory is residing. Current Native Objects being drawn in the Memory Map therefore is not 100% guaranteed to be showing the correct amount of contiguous memory owned by this object, but at least it no longer draws over other Objects or outside of the Region or Allocation it resides in. <a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/1278205/">(Case 1278205)</a></li>
<li>Fixed Memory map colors for Objects and Allocations drawn outside of regions. <a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/1278203/">(Case 1278203)</a></li>
<li>Fixed Memory Map to not draw anything or a white background outside of actual memory address usage. The pixels for these regions where no longer correctly cleared to full transparency.</li>
<li>Fixed Memory Map to not draw Virtual Machine memory as Managed Stack Memory in improbably high virtual address space. (Reporting of Managed Stack memory is not yet supported. Virtual Machine memory was miss-read as stack memory by the crawler.)</li>
<li>Fixed Memory Map Diff to draw lines correctly again as green, red, yellow or purple instead of drawing all lines as red.</li>
<li>Changed &quot;Native Memory Regions&quot; table to &quot;All Memory Regions&quot; table, naming Managed Memory Regions as either &quot;Managed Heap Memory Section&quot; or &quot;Virtual Machine Memory Section&quot; and showing this table in Memory Map details section when opting to look at Regions.</li>
<li>Changed Memory map to show the new &quot;All Native Allocations&quot; table when displaying allocations to provide more accessible information on the details of the allocations.</li>
<li>Changed &quot;Import&quot; button to use an icon instead of text and moved it to the right side of the toolbar.</li>
<li>Changed the link text for the Native Instance ID column to ping the object it belongs to, if the capture was taken from the current Editor session.</li>
<li>Clarified UI of the snapshot list to show more clearly which snapshots are open <a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/1129613/">(Case 1129613)</a></li>
<li>Changed loading of Snapshot preview screenshots to happen asynchronously to speed up opening the window and rebuilding it after Domain Reload.</li>
<li>Improved Memory Map selection workflow, hinting that the table below it needs a selection to show anything and clarifying why there might be no data.</li>
<li>Fixed Memory Map deselection not affecting the view immediately.</li>
