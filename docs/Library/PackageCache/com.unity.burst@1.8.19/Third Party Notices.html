<p>Portions of this software are derived from third-party works licensed under terms compatible with the above MIT license:</p>
<p>The TRE regular expression implementation (src/regex/reg* and src/regex/tre*) is Copyright © 2001-2008 Ville Laurikari and licensed under a 2-clause BSD license (license text in the source files). The included version has been heavily modified by Rich Felker in 2012, in the interests of size, simplicity, and namespace cleanliness.</p>
<p>Much of the math library code (src/math/* and src/complex/*) is Copyright © 1993,2004 Sun Microsystems or Copyright © 2003-2011 David Schultz or Copyright © 2003-2009 Steven G. Kargl or Copyright © 2003-2009 Bruce D. Evans or Copyright © 2008 Stephen L. Moshier and labelled as such in comments in the individual source files. All have been licensed under extremely permissive terms.</p>
<p>The ARM memcpy code (src/string/arm/memcpy_el.S) is Copyright © 2008 The Android Open Source Project and is licensed under a two-clause BSD license. It was taken from Bionic libc, used on Android.</p>
<p>The implementation of DES for crypt (src/crypt/crypt_des.c) is Copyright © 1994 David Burren. It is licensed under a BSD license.</p>
<p>The implementation of blowfish crypt (src/crypt/crypt_blowfish.c) was originally written by Solar Designer and placed into the public domain. The code also comes with a fallback permissive license for use in jurisdictions that may not recognize the public domain.</p>
<p>The smoothsort implementation (src/stdlib/qsort.c) is Copyright © 2011 Valentin Ochs and is licensed under an MIT-style license.</p>
<p>The x86_64 port was written by Nicholas J. Kain and is licensed under the standard MIT terms.</p>
<p>The mips and microblaze ports were originally written by Richard Pennington for use in the ellcc project. The original code was adapted by Rich Felker for build system and code conventions during upstream integration. It is licensed under the standard MIT terms.</p>
<p>The mips64 port was contributed by Imagination Technologies and is licensed under the standard MIT terms.</p>
<p>The powerpc port was also originally written by Richard Pennington, and later supplemented and integrated by John Spencer. It is licensed under the standard MIT terms.</p>
<p>All other files which have no copyright comments are original works produced specifically for use as part of this library, written either by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or by one or more contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of individual files can be found in the git version control history of the project. The omission of copyright and license comments in each file is in the interest of source tree size.</p>
<p>In addition, permission is hereby granted for all public header files (include/* and arch//bits/) and crt files intended to be linked into applications (crt/, ldso/dlstart.c, and arch//crt_arch.h) to omit the copyright notice and permission notice otherwise required by the license, and to use these files without any requirement of attribution. These files include substantial contributions from:</p>
<p>Bobby Bingham John Spencer Nicholas J. Kain Rich Felker Richard Pennington Stefan Kristiansson Szabolcs Nagy</p>
<p>all of whom have explicitly granted such permission.</p>
<p>This file previously contained text expressing a belief that most of the files covered by the above exception were sufficiently trivial not to be subject to copyright, resulting in confusion over whether it negated the permissions granted in the license. In the spirit of permissive licensing, and of not having licensing issues being an obstacle to adoption, that text has been removed.</p>

means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
meet the following conditions:</p>
<p>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>
<p>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that You changed the files; and</p>
<p>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

<p>(d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.</p>
<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

<li><p>Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
