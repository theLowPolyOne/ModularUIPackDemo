<ul>
<li>Fixed the managed fallback for bursts intrinsic functions <code>cvt_ss2si</code>, <code>cvtss_si32</code>, and <code>cvtss_si64</code> to follow midpoint rounding standard of nearest even.</li>

<h3 id="changed-17">Changed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Always preserve frame pointers in Burst. This results in a neglible performance hit (less than 0.5% in benchmarks), but ensures that stack recovery for stack traces is always possible.</li>
<li>Class libraries are now built with netstandard 2.0</li>
<li>The minimum Xcode version to build for iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS with Burst is now 12.0.0.</li>
<li>Upgraded Burst to use LLVM Version 13.0.1 by default, bringing the latest optimization improvements from the LLVM project.</li>
<li>Fixed &quot;error while hashing&quot; message that could appear during compilation</li>
<li>Made Burst explicitly check for any compilation requests that came from <code>AssemblyBuilder</code>, and do not compile these with Burst. These exist outside the normal compilation pipeline, and Burst could not support them (but we now explicitly check for that case).</li>
<li>Made Burst's ILPP 22% faster by caching dependent assemblies that the being-processed assembly uses.</li>
<li>Changed how we process static readonly fields in static constructors such that we'll allow more computational budget per static field. This fixes the case where having too many static readonly variables in a single static constructor could fail to compile, while they would work if each was in their own static constructors.</li>

<li>Upgraded Burst to use LLVM Version 14.0.0 by default, bringing the latest optimization improvements from the LLVM project.</li>

<ul>
<li>Error if install in build folder is used without ever using a regular build.</li>
<li>Fixed a performance regression with <code>IJobParallelFor</code> where vectorization didn't happen for cases where it previously would have.</li>
<li>Fixed a compiler miscompile if you loaded a <code>static readonly v128</code> and passed it straight to a function as an argument.</li>
<li>Removed implicit dependencies to pre-compile binaries in CodeGen which would otherwise cause assembly resolution conflicts.</li>
<li>Fixed a Unity 2021.2 and newer bug that manifested with UWP builds - we were using the wrong <code>unityaot</code> folder in the Unity editor distribution with Burst.</li>
<li>Fixed a really subtle caching bug in the compiler where if you had a job that compiled successfully at least once, then it failed (you used managed state for instance), then you closed the editor and restarted, if the compiler threads started in precisely a strange combination then Burst might accidentally never recompile the job which failed previously.</li>
<li>Fixed potential hang in Editor when compiling a Burst entry point method that is defined in a generic class</li>
<li>Fix for the <code>X.pdb: The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process</code> issue our users were seeing. We were taking a <code>FileShare.Read</code> lock, when we needed to take <code>FileShare.ReadWrite</code>.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the compiler would reject a <code>try</code>/<code>finally</code> statement if it was the first thing in a method</li>
<li>Fixed a performance regression affecting some vectorization in Burst 1.7+ (LLVM 12+).</li>
<li>Inspector performance regression.</li>
<li>Improved UWP linker error message to clarify which VS components need to be installed for UWP</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that meant Burst was accidentally enabled in secondary Unity processes, including the asset import worker and out-of-process profiler (see changelog entry for 1.6.0-pre.1 for more context around this)</li>
<li>Keybindings for copy and selection did not depend on OS.</li>
<li>Right pane vertical scrollbar not always showing correctly.</li>
<li>Inspector font style changing when entering and exiting play mode.</li>
<li>Fixed access violation error that could occur when reading from a static readonly variable</li>
<li>Made <code>--burst-force-sync-compilation</code> command-line option actually work</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that was exposed by a Script Updater running against the Entities tests, whereby if some sort of pre-domain-reload code (some sort of teardown like thing) called into Burst, the script updater could have caused Burst to purge valid function pointers, resulting in us trying to execute a DLL location that we had already unloaded.</li>
<li>Fixed a super rare bug whereby if you kicked off two compilations very close together (most likely when running Unity in some sort of headless build-a-player mode), Burst could throw an exception on a burst hash cache file being locked by the process.</li>
<li>Fix a bug where if you had a long running compilation and a new compilation came in, some threads in the thread pool could (if unlucky) block trying to dirty the assembly in our Burst caching infrastructure while waiting for the compilation to complete.</li>
<li>Fix a bug where codegen differences could occur when using a local vector variable that was being captured by reference and passed to a called function, versus when it wasn't.</li>
<li>Fixed an exception that could occur if you had the Burst AOT Settings menu docked in the Editor, and then did a player build. Trying to change any of the Burst AOT Settings would throw an exception (unless you closed and reopened the Burst AOT Settings).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where we could leave background tasks around forever when we had actually completed them (could only happen if two re-compilation requests arrived close together, meaning we'd cancel the first but never report to the background tasks that we had cancelled them!).</li>
<li>Fix the Burst <code>link.xml</code> output to preserve C# methods we rely on, alongside the static constructors that we preserved previously.</li>
<li>Fixed errors when working with paths containing special characters</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where if you used <code>FloatMode.Fast</code> with <code>math.pow</code>, where the <code>y</code> argument to <code>math.pow</code> was actually sourced from an integer, illegal codegen would be generated (LLVM would try and call out to <code>powf</code> from the cstdlib).</li>
<li>Worked around an ordering issue with post-processing in 2020.3 and earlier by deferring the early compilation of script assemblies in the editor until the entire pipeline has completed.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in 2022.1+ where calling <code>Debug.Log</code> in a static constructor would result in a Burst failure.</li>
<li>Fixed another rare case of the file-is-locked bug where the Burst IL Post Processor could incorrectly hold a file lock on a pdb.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug when calling profiling <code>CreateMarker</code> on iOS, Burst could fail at runtime saying it was unable to find <code>CreateMarker__Unmanaged</code>.</li>
<li>Fixed that the <code>crc32_u64</code> second parameter should have been a <code>ulong</code>. Added a new <code>ulong</code> variant and marked the old <code>long</code> variant as <code>[Obsolete]</code>.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where using <code>ReinterpretStore(someIndex, (ushort)someValue)</code> could cause an internal compiler error in Burst.</li>
<li>Fixed a potential deadlock whereby if Burst was compiling in the background (the background tasks window showed Burst in it) and a user switched from release to debug in the editor, Burst could cause a deadlock.</li>
<li>A potential issue with the debug info mover pass, that meant it only affected the first entry point in a module</li>
<li>Fixed hashing error that could occur with unbound generic type</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where if you had synchronous compilation on a job, disabled Burst compilation and entered playmode, then exited playmode, and finally re-enabled Burst compilation, a hang could occur.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where toggling Burst enable &lt;-&gt; disable during a playmode execution using Burst, and then attaching the managed debugger, could cause an editor crash.</li>
<li>Fixed a memory leak where during hashing we'd pin a GC object and never unpin and free it.</li>
<li>Fix burst inspector sometimes stalling during loading for script reloads.</li>
<li>Fixed a super rare bug where Burst could hit an internal error with <code>System.InvalidOperationException: Nullable object must have a value</code>.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression where out parameters of C# 9.0 function pointers weren't working in Burst.</li>
<li>Fixed internal compiler error when encountering a <code>calli</code> with closed generics</li>
<li>Fixed bug in static constructor ordering in the presence of indirect dependencies between static constructors (i.e. static constructor -&gt; static method -&gt; static constructor) that could result in a runtime crash</li>
<li>Added workaround for &quot;cannot dlopen until fork() handlers have completed&quot; issue seen in macOS 12.3</li>
<li>Fixed compiler crash when trying to dynamically call <code>BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer</code>  in Burst-compiled code</li>
<li>Fix compiler crash when the only usage of a static field was in a formatted exception string</li>
<li>Fixed burst inspector sometimes not rendering text or rendering text on top of other text.</li>
<li>Fixed selection rendering off-by-one error at last line of each block.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with <code>Span</code> and <code>ReadOnlySpan</code> types where if the indices used were not already 32-bit signed integers, an internal compiler error would occur if running with safety checks enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed a really convoluted bug that could manifest in Burst returning out of date cached libraries, which would manifest as random exceptions in Burst jobs/function-pointers (users deleting the BurstCache would workaround the bug).</li>

<h2 id="160-pre3---2021-07-27">[1.6.0-pre.3] - 2021-07-27</h2>
<h3 id="fixed-20">Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where methods with the same name and namespace, but in different assemblies, could resolve to the wrong method.</li>
<li>Burst no longer logs a warning when opening the standalone Profiler</li>
<li>Fixed an <code>UnauthorizedAccessException</code> that could occur when using Burst in players built for the macOS App Sandbox</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause an incorrect compilation error when using a primitive type as a generic argument in a static method entry point</li>
<li>Crash due to member function debug information on tvOS.</li>
<li>Fix documentation to make clear that <code>ref</code> / <code>out</code> parameters are supported on <code>[BurstDiscard]</code> methods.</li>
<li>Fixed a <code>NullReferenceException</code> in the Burst compiler when multi-dimensional arrays were used. The compiler now produces a correct error message telling users that multi-dimensional arrays are not supported by Burst.</li>
<li>Fixed DOTS Runtime Job Marshalling behaviour to properly handle marshalling generic Job types when not all closed forms of the generic type require marshalling.</li>
<li>Fixed a Burst package warning in our editor compiler integration with respect to <code>BuildOptions.EnableHeadlessMode</code>.</li>
<li>Fixed small race which could cause an unexpected exception when finishing a standalone compilation task.</li>
<li>Building for Apple Silicon architecture on macOS would produce a universal binary, now it behaves correctly.</li>
<li>tvOS/iOS and other statically linked platforms would fail to burst compile if the burst compiled code contained references to functions that were <code>[DllImport(&quot;__Internal&quot;)]</code>, due to a mismatch in calling convention.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug whereby if you had <code>$&quot;{too} {many} {fixed} {string} {formatted} {arguments}&quot;</code> in a string formatter, Burst wouldn't be able to correctly understand how to transform this for the purposes of logging or fixed-string construction.</li>
<li>Fixed where <code>Unity.Burst.CompilerServices.Constant.IsConstantExpression</code> is evaluated to be later in the compilation pipeline, to let it catch more constant expressions (for instance post-inlining).</li>
<li>Rare non zero return code from bcl after successfully building..</li>
<li>Only check assembly cache when the main-thread is requesting some Burst code - meaning that kicking off eager compilation is 1.6x faster than before.</li>
<li><code>stackalloc byte[]</code> with an array initializer was previously only supported when the <code>stackalloc</code> size was 8 or less. Sizes greater than 8 are now supported.</li>
<li>Fixed an error that could occur with the form &quot;System.InvalidOperationException: Could not find <code>burst.initialize</code> function in library 'SomeLibrary'&quot;</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect runtime behavior that could occur when casting a pointer to a generic type</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where stackalloc's could be wrongly hoisted out of loops.</li>
<li>Added [Preserve] attribute to prevent stripping a compiler service call</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect compiler error that could occur when casting a pointer to a generic type and then calling a method with generic parameters</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect compiler error that could occur with explicit-layout structs when setting a <code>Size</code> smaller than the natural struct size</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="added-20">Added</h3>
<ul>
<li>Universal (Apple Silicon + X64) versions of extra build tools</li>
<li>Add Android x86_64 and re-enable x86 support</li>
<li>Added support for having <code>[MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.U1)]</code> or <code>[MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.I1)]</code> on a <code>bool</code> external function parameter.</li>
<li>Neon intrinsics: Added vst1* experimental APIs</li>
<li>Added a global player build setting to let users specify the default optimization choice for Burst.</li>
<li>Native support for Apple Silicon.</li>
<li>Added support for <code>StructLayoutAttribute.Pack</code></li>
<li>Additional notes about <code>BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer&lt;T&gt;</code> regarding; avoid wrapping in another open generic method, and interoperability with IL2CPP.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="removed-19">Removed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Removed the <code>Enable Safety Checks</code> option for player builds, since it didn't actually enable safety checks in containers, which are editor only in Unity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="changed-20">Changed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Changed how we link object files for iOS and tvOS platforms such that Burst will now create the object file and hand it off to XCode for linking only.</li>
<li>Assembly-level attributes (such as <code>[assembly: RegisterGenericJobType]</code>) are now scanned for generic job types to compile</li>
<li>Fixed a regression that caused eager-compilation at Editor startup to be slower than it should have been</li>
<li><code>math.f16tof32</code> now uses hardware intrinsics where available (AVX2 / NEON).</li>
<li><code>half</code> to <code>float</code> or <code>double</code> vector conversions now produce more optimal codegen.</li>
<li>Burst Inspector now remembers scroll position between domain reloads</li>
<li>Changed how we schedule Burst eager compilation threads. Previously we'd spawn at most 8 of the threads, and only allow 2 to make progress while in the Editor (to ensure the editor UX/UI was as responsive as possible). Instead we now spawn <code>number_of_cores - 1</code> threads at a lower thread priority, ensuring that any computing power slack can be consumed to speed up Burst compilation. On a 24 core machine this resulted in 2.5x reduction in time taken for Burst to fully compile a large project.</li>
<li>Fixed a potential error related to duplicate symbols when calling <code>BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer</code> from inside Burst code</li>
<li>Improved performance of checking the cache to see if methods have already been compiled</li>
<li>For player builds : lib_burst_generated.txt, pdbs (in non development mode) and dysm folders are now placed into a xxx_BurstDebugInformation_DoNotShip folder alongside the data folder, this is to ensure it is easy to remove the files that you should not ship with your player.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="160-pre1---2021-04-14">[1.6.0-pre.1] - 2021-04-14</h2>
<h3 id="changed-21">Changed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Start 1.6 release cycle</li>
<li>Changed how we resolve function references in the compiler to improve resolving an existing function reference by 3x.</li>
<li>Improve how we handle generic resolution in Cecil to cache the strictly resolved generic types and save a bunch of time in the compiler.</li>
<li>Exception strings no longer contain the entry-point name of the job/function-pointer that caused the throw. This change was required because the Burst compiler has to produce deterministic results from any given compile, which is fundamentally opposed to per-entry-point function derivations.</li>
<li>Changed how SLEEF global variables for trig functions are pulled into Burst to reduce duplications.</li>
<li>Changed how exceptions throw types and messages are stored in our Burst binaries to reduce binary size.</li>
<li>Constant array data is now named after the static field it belongs to in assembly</li>
<li>Upgraded Burst to use LLVM Version 11.0.1 by default, bringing the latest optimization improvements from the LLVM project.</li>
<li>The <code>Unity.Burst.Intrinsics.Common.Pause</code> intrinsic is no longer experimental.</li>
<li>DOTS Runtime shares the logging code path with the general case</li>
<li>Armv8.2 Neon intrinsics are now fully supported</li>
<li>Disable threading within the <code>lld</code> linker instances we use for in-editor and desktop cross compilation, because we're already threading seperate process instances of <code>lld</code> and it results in lot of OS context switching.</li>
<li>Tweaked how the IL Post Processed 'direct call' Burst function pointers are compiled so that the compilation is deferred until they are needed (previously we'd enqueue them all for compilation on a domain reload).</li>
<li>Changed Burst minimum editor version to 2019.4</li>
<li>Use rpmalloc as our native allocator on Windows to speed up concurrently executing LLVM work.</li>
<li>When Burst has previously compiled a method, and neither the assembly containing that method nor any of that assembly's dependencies have changed, it was possible after a domain reload for the Mono version of the method to be used for a short time before being replaced by the Burst version. This has now been improved such that the Burst version will be used immediately.</li>
<li>Improved iteration speed by reducing the time it takes for Burst to check if any Burst-compilable code has changed</li>
<li>Change our link step to not use response files if the command line was smaller enough, saving the cost of the round-trip to the disk.</li>
<li>Made half &lt;-&gt; float / double conversions use native hardware where possible (Arm or AVX2 targets).</li>
<li>In order to prevent conflicts with the main Unity process, Burst is now inactive in secondary Unity processes, including the asset import worker and out-of-process profiler. This means that in those secondary processes, code that would normally be Burst-compiled will now run under Mono. In a future release of Burst, we hope to lift this restriction and allow Burst-compiled code to run in secondary Unity processes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fixed-22">Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in LLVM that it would incorrectly convert some memset -&gt; memcpy if both pointers derived from the same memory address, and where one indexed into the 0th element of the pointer.</li>

<li>Private <code>[BurstCompile]</code> methods no longer throw <code>MethodAccessException</code></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the Burst post-processing for direct call would cause duplicate function pointers to be compiled, wasting compile time in the editor and caused an Editor launch stall.</li>
<li>Corrected 'Enable safety checks tooltip`.</li>
<li>Fixed a minor debug information bug where built-in types with methods (like <code>System.Int32</code>) would generate incorrect debug information.</li>
<li>Fixed a very obscure bug where if you had a function-pointer that was called from another function-pointer of job, and that function-pointer happened to be compiled in a player build in the same bucket as the caller, and the no-alias cloning analysis identified that it could clone the original function-pointer to enable more aliasing optimizations, it could create a duplicate symbol error.</li>
<li>Revert to internal linkage for Android X86 (32bit) to ensure ABI compliance.</li>
<li>Fixed compilation errors when targeting Arm CPUs and using some of the Intel intrinsics</li>
<li>Added PreserveAttribute to prevent the internal log from being stripped in il2cpp builds.</li>
<li>IL Function Pointer Invoke Transformation updated to handle transforms that affect instructions that are the destination of a branch.</li>
<li>IL Function Pointer Invoke Transformation now uses correct runtime library for dots runtime.</li>
<li>Fixed compilation errors when targeting Intel CPUs and using some of the Arm Neon intrinsics</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where eager-compilation could pick up out-of-date global Burst menu options for compiling.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the progress bar would report double the amount of pending compile jobs if a user changed the Burst options while background compilation was going on.</li>
<li>Fixed some intrinsics not checking target CPU against required CPU, so it was possible to use some intrinsics without an IsXXXSupported check</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where having any <code>[DllImport]</code> in a class that used the Direct Call mechanism could result in an illegal <code>CompileFunctionPointer</code> call being produced by our post processor.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where if a user used a math function (like <code>cos</code>, <code>sin</code>, etc) then LLVM would preserve both the scalar and vector implementations even if they were trivially dead, causing us to inject otherwise dead functions into the resulting binary.</li>
<li>PDB debug information for instance methods that also used struct return were incorrect.</li>
<li>When generating Line Table only debug information, an unreachable could occur due to a missing check.</li>
<li>Fixed the 1.5 restriction that Direct Call methods can only be called from the main thread, now they work when called from any thread.</li>
<li>Internal Compiler Error if a call was discarded (via BurstDiscard for example), but the callsites required an ABI transform e.g. struct return.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with using multiple <code>IsXXXSupported</code> intrinsics in the same boolean condition would fail.</li>
<li>Broken link restored for known issues with debugging and profiling.</li>
<li>The Direct Call injected delegate now has a unique suffix to avoid type-name clashes.</li>

<li>Fixed a possible DivideByZeroException due to race condition in TermInfoDriver initialization code.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the multi-CPU dispatcher (used for player builds targetting multiple CPU architectures) could end up generating invalid instructions.</li>
<li>Gracefully handle failing to find a particular assembly in the ILPP to prevent an ICE.</li>
<li>function calls using in modifiers on blittable structs where being treated as non blittable.</li>
<li>crash when extracting sequence point information for error reporting/debug information generation.</li>
<li>Direct Call extension methods that only differ on argument types are now supported (previously Burst's <code>AssemblyLoader</code> would complain about multiple matches).</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="added-21">Added</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added links to blog posts from the burst team to the Burst documentation.</li>
<li>Intrinsics: Neon - Added support for basic vld1 APIs</li>
<li>Can now call BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer() in Burst code</li>
<li>Add support for the C# 8.0 construct <code>default(T) is null</code> to Burst by transforming the generated <code>Box</code> + 'is the box non-null?' at compile time.</li>
<li>Make it possible to get a pointer to UTF-8 encoded string literal data in HPC# code via StringLiteral.UTF8()</li>
<li>Add an <code>OptimizeFor</code> option to <code>[BurstCompile]</code>, allowing users to say they want fast code, small code, or fastly compiled code.</li>
<li>Known issue with Windows Native Debuggers and Dll numbers + workarounds.</li>
<li>Assemblies are now allowed to have an <code>[assembly: BurstCompile()]</code> attribute to let users specify compile options that should apply assembly wide (for instance <code>[assembly: BurstCompile(OptimizeFor = OptimizeFor.FastCompilation)]</code>).</li>
<li>Automatically add [UnmanagedFunctionPointer(CallingConvention.Cdecl)] to any delegates that are used for BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer&lt;&gt;() or error if the delegate has the attribute and it is not Cdecl.</li>
<li>Source location metadata into hash cache.</li>
<li>Added support for having <code>[return: MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.U1)]</code> or <code>[return: MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.I1)]</code> on a <code>bool</code> return external function.</li>
<li>An additional warning about delegates being used by <code>BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer</code> that are not decorated as expected. In most cases, Burst will automatically add the C-declaration attribute in IL Post Processing, but if the usage of CompileFunctionPointer is abstracted away behind an open generic implementation, then Burst will not be able to automatically correct the delegate declaration, and thus this warning will fire.</li>
<li>new <code>burst_TargetPlatform_EmbeddedLinux</code></li>
<li>new <code>AotNativeLinkEmbeddedLinux</code> for EmbeddedLinux</li>
<li>Added a new <code>OptimizeFor</code> mode <code>Balanced</code>. This becomes the default optimization mode, and trades off slightly lower maximum performance for much faster compile times.</li>

<li>If the only reference to an external function was discarded, don't attempt to add it to the burst initialisation block (which caused on ICE on prior versions).</li>
<li>Fixed a case where extracting a <code>FixedString4096</code> from a parent struct could cause very slow compile times.</li>

<li>Improved eager-compilation performance</li>
<li>Improved Burst Inspector loading time</li>
<li>Improved Burst initialization time</li>

<li>Transitioning from burst disabled to burst enabled in editor, will perform a re-initialise of some internal state in use by Direct Call methods.</li>
<li>Improved the performance of in-compiler hashing by 1.2x.</li>
<li>Improved our hashing performance some more by re-using fixed-sized buffers in the compiler to improve eager-compilation / warm-cache costs by 1.25x.</li>

<h2 id="140-preview3---2020-08-06">[1.4.0-preview.3] - 2020-08-06</h2>
<h3 id="added-24">Added</h3>
<ul>
<li>VS 2017 support for platform that needs it.</li>
<li>Added first batch of Arm Neon intrinsics. Currently, only ArmV8 (AArch64) targets are supported. The supported intrinsics include all ArmV7 and ArmV8 ones.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="removed-23">Removed</h3>
<h3 id="changed-25">Changed</h3>
<ul>
<li>In versions of Unity older than 2019.3, changing the following options in the Burst menu now requires the Editor to be restarted: Enable Compilation, Safety Checks, and Native Debug Mode Compilation. In versions of Unity older than 2019.3, previously-compiled methods will not be recompiled after changing those options, which could lead to undefined behavior where methods may or may not be compiled with the correct options. This change removes that possibility.</li>
<li>Improved performance of &quot;eager-compilation&quot; (scheduling compilation immediately after assemblies are changed) by cancelling queued eager-compilation when entering play mode with Synchronous Compilation unchecked</li>
<li>Improved performance of eager-compilation by not eager-compiling test assemblies</li>
<li>Asserts that are currently discarded no longer discard arguments with potential side effects.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fixed-26">Fixed</h3>
<ul>
<li>We no longer attempt to replace the debug metadata multiple times for a given export.</li>
<li>Fixed a subtle codegen bug that could occur when the target is an Arm or AArch64 CPU with vectors of 3 elements.</li>
<li>Inspector slow down when scrolling/moving the window on large listings.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where a <code>stfld</code> into an element of a vector could deduce the wrong type for the underlying vector.</li>
<li>Fixed a potential error when running the linker with a failure on lld command.</li>
<li>If path to the package contained spaces, then native command execution could fail. This would manifiest as weird errors with 'lld' or 'vswhere' or other native tools.</li>
<li>Fixed Debug.Log by re-enabling it when used in function pointers or jobs.</li>
<li>Fixed errors when opening Inspector with a non-public Execute method on a job producer type</li>

<li>Improved our aliasing detection to allow <code>DynamicBuffer</code> structs to be easily vectorizable.</li>
<li>Added a compiler warning for any use of throwing an exception from a method <strong>not guarded by</strong> <code>[Conditional(&quot;ENABLE_UNITY_COLLECTIONS_CHECKS&quot;)]</code>. Since exceptions in Burst are only supported in the editor, this provides a useful warning to users who may be relying on try/catch behaviors for control-flow which is not supported in final game builds.</li>
